                    My personal wedding site created for Design for the Web I during the Fall 2021 semester. This course did not yet involve responsive design so the site is static and meant mainly for desktop screens. The site was used to give guests information and collect RSVPs for my wedding in October 2022 and worked out very well! The actual site with custom domain is no longer up but a live site is still accessible below through my GitHub. Scroll down to view the invitations I created to go alongside the website!

                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    This project was a unique opportunity that came from me planning my wedding while also starting my web design coursework. I wanted something I could fully customize rather than the cookie cutter sites that are commonly seen for weddings. The design was based around our wedding colors (navy and gold) and much of it was created based on what I found to be most aesthetically pleasing. I wanted the site to represent us well while still being an enjoyable experience for our guests to navigate through. Everything was created with HTML and CSS aside from a plugin used to collect RSVPs that came from AnRSVP, a tool I would highly recommend to anyone else creating their own site as it was the only one I found that allows users to embed their forms freely. The site was originally hosted at thecreehans.com but has since been taken down as the wedding date has passed. Our guests loved the site and had no issues aside from a couple of late RSVPs that came through to my email after the form was closed! Everything functioned as intended and helped us cut down on the amount of questions asked of us as we had the Q&A and travel information readily available. This was a great learning experience for me and in the end turned out to be one of the smoothest parts of wedding planning as a whole.
