                    A selection of coursework from my Animation I class. I don't consider myself an animator, but I thought these project turned out well despite my limited experience. Displayed are all of the final versions of various projects.

                <h2>Final Project - Three Panel Story</h2>

                <p>The prompt for my final Animation I project was to create a story told in three panels. This was first sketched out frame by frame in Procreate and then brought into Adobe Animate to line and color each frame.</p>

                <h2>Personality Walk Cycle</h2>

                <p>This was the next step after completing a basic walk cycle with a blank character. This was meant to show a character and personality along with the walk cycle to make it more challenging and unique. I chose to work with a zombie-styled walk in which the character is dragging one foot behind and doesn't have full autonomy over their movements, so is somewhat lurched backwards with a rotting mouth where the tongue hangs out. This was mainly rigged in Adobe Animate but some areas were drawn by hand as needed to make the animation as smooth as possible. The character itself was drawn by me.</p>

                <h2>Flour Sack</h2>

                <p>This flour sack animation was meant to give the feel of animating a character without having actual limbs, facial features, etc. The flour sack is meant to show some character all on its own and the story being told was chosen from a list of prompts. I chose one where it is woken up to a loud noise and then scared away. Each frame was drawn by hand using a Wacom tablet in Adobe Animate.</p>

                <h2>Car Driving Cycle</h2>

                <p>This project had us take a car we had animated previously and place it in an environment as it drives through. This was all done directly in Adobe Animate through the use of cycles and tweens. The drawing of the car was supplied while the rest was created by me.</p>
