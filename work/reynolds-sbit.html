                    The School of Business and Industrial Trades site under Reynolds Community College. Mockups were created as a class project in the Spring 22 semester and the site was then developed as a part of a Fall 22 internship that I collaborated on with one other intern.                </p>

                <h2>Planning</h2>

                <p>
                    Multiple personas and scenarios were created during our coursework. Shown below are the ones I created while conducting research before moving forward with wireframes.
                </p>

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>

                <p>
                    My focus was mainly the SBIT homepage and the Administration of Justice program while in the early stages of coursework. Below is the wireframe I originally created for the homepage as well as this program - some changes were made before moving forward to the mockup.                </p>
                </p>

                        A copy of the original mockup, initially intended to reflect changes that had been made to the original site's header/footer before we were able to change these items ourselves. This was also used to explore different possibilities for a new header.                    </figcaption>
