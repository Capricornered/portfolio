                <p>
                    A variety of landing page mockups I've created as personal projects throughout my design coursework and beyond. These are all for fictional brands of my own creation with images sourced from Unsplash and Pexels. I tend to work in Adobe XD for most of my own projects but plan to add mockups from Figma and potientially other programs in the future.

                    A landing page with placeholder content based around lyrics from "The Saltwater Room" by Owl City. This is meant to represent a sort of blog/article site with featured articles and a newsletter sign-up form.

                    E-commerce landing page for a fictional hair dye brand sporting bold, neon colors. I came up with this concept based on a <a href="https://perchance.org/moodboard-generator">moodboard generator</a>, which I used as a challenge to come up with the content and colors for the page based on the first board it gave me.
