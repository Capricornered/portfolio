                    All graphic design pieces that don't require enough information to warrant a separate page. Most of these are from my typography and graphic design coursework.

                    Final project for Graphic Design I that required a "marketing facelift" for a local business of our choice. This was to include a social media post or webpage, a one-sided flyer, and a business card.

                <p>
                    Concert poster created to look like a hatch show print for the band Bones UK. This was for a fictionalized concert but based on a real band. Everything was done digitally but meant to look like it was from a traditional letterpress shop.

                <h2>Horror Movie Poster</h2>

                <p>
                    A poster for a fictional horror movie I called <i>A Day to Dismember</i>, heavily inspired by the song "Wurst Vacation" from the band Ice Nine Kills, which is in turn inspired by the <i>Hostel</i> franchise. I wanted to come up with something that would invoke similar feelings to <i>Hostel</i> or <i>Saw</i> while still giving it my own flair.

                <h2>Typeface + Type Specimen Poster</h2>

                <p>
                    I created a typeface I named "It's a Sign", meant to mimic traditional sign painting. This was drawn in Procreate then taken to Photoshop to create the complete type specimen poster.
