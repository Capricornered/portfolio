                    I was invited to work as a Graphic Designer for Brightpoint Community College through their Career and Education Consortium. This includes the first two projects I worked on. First is a booklet created for the 2022 Crater Region Reverse Career Fair, meant to allow businesses to come and view displays created by students. Second is the flyer for the signing day that came after the fair.

                <h2>Reverse Career Fair Booklet</h2>

                <p>
                    Starting out with this project I was given full creative freedom, so I decided to develop a sort of logo for the fair to use on the front of the booklet. I decided to create an open briefcase with some papers showing, along with arrows coming around the front and back of the briefcase to illustrate the idea of it being in "reverse". This was originally hand-drawn in procreate and then brought into Adobe Illustrator to finalize it before creating the full booklet in Adobe InDesign. Students would be creating displays to show what they had to offer while employers would be receiving these booklets to give them information on how the career fair would work. I was asked to include the Workforce Ready Diploma Seal, so I played off of the gear in the seal in my design for the rest of the booklet. As this was an event for high school students, I didn't want to go overly "corporate" in my design, but keep it somewhat fun and colorful while still giving all of the needed information. I kept the orange and gray of the diploma seal as the main colors, but added a teal and purple to give it some more visual interest. I curved the textboxes to go alongside the curves of the gears, and placed them differently on each page to show some movement.

                <h2>Signing Day Flyer</h2>

                <p>
                    This flyer was developed soon after the booklet, to be used for the signing day that resulted from the career fair. This was just a quick informational flyer that I used a similar design for in order to have it look cohesive with the original booklet.
