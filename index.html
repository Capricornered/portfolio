                    I'm a recent graduate and one of the first three to do so from the new Web Design program at Brightpoint Community College. I have been interested in web design from a young age, and started teaching myself HTML and CSS around age 10. I wasn't doing anything advanced of course, but my love of code has remained to this day and I have thoroughly enjoyed building on those skills. I have always been an artist and I love both the artsy side of design and the more technical side of front-end development. When I'm not behind a computer screen, you can usually find me spending time with my husband, our Great Dane, and my two Guinea Pigs! I am currently looking for entry-level work, and spending my free time working on this portfolio site. If you would like to reach out for any reason, please hit the contact button to find my email address and a link to download my resume! Thank you for stopping by.
